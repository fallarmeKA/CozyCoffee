  story = "Coffee Haven began in 2010 when two friends, passionate about exceptional coffee, decided to create a space where quality and community could thrive together. What started as a small cart in the local farmers' market has grown into the warm, inviting space you see today. We source our beans directly from small-scale farmers across the globe, ensuring ethical practices and the highest quality. Each cup we serve carries the story of the hands that nurtured it from seed to harvest. Our roasting process, perfected over years of dedication, brings out the unique character of every bean variety. At Coffee Haven, we believe that great coffee creates moments of connection â€“ between people, cultures, and traditions.",
